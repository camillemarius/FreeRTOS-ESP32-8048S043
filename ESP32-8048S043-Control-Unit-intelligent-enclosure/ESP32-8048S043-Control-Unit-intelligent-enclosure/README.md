# Sunton_ESP32-8048S043-Control-Unit
<<<<<<< HEAD

Basic board setup and running using PlatformIO
this is based on the info found on:
https://www.makerfabs.com/sunton-esp32-s3-4-3-inch-ips-with-touch.html

This will setup the Display with touch and run the LVGL demo project. As a graphic
backend it will use "GFX Library for Arduino" but it would be nice to test LovyanGFX
in the future and benchmark them.

This project would be a good starting point if you want to use this devboard, just clone it and rename it and do your own stuff.

As it took a bit of effort to get a simple project up I thought I should share the result so the it would be easier for other to get started.

There is basically nothing magic here just a PlatfornIO project ready to start using based on the info and project found from a Sunton zip with a Arduino project

Possible future improvemnets

Proper partition memory setup
SD Card setup
WIFI usage and setup, with WiFiManager?
BT setup
LittleFS setup
OTA
But this will probably end up in other project, there is a lot of examples setting this up for ESP32 out there.
